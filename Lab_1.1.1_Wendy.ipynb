    "Why do we invert matrices? We need to invert matrices because we cannot divide matrices. Matrix \"division\" is actually just multiplying a matrix by its inverse, to get the identity matrix. Say we have the equation 1=YX, with Y and X being matrices. If we want to solve for X, we need to divide by Y. Instead, we will have to multiply by the inverse of Y, so that we get Y**−1=X. \n",
    "Use the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) To invert a matrix, start by adding an identity matrix to the right of the matrix. \n",
    "2) The basic row operations on the combined matrix are: \n",
    "We can swap any two rows. \n",
    "We can multiply any row by a number than isn’t zero. \n",
    "We can add a row times a number to another row. \n",
    "3) The goal is to get the matrix on the left in row echelon form: \n",
    "All rows with at least one nonzero element are above any rows of all zeroes. \n",
    "The first nonzero number from the left of a nonzero row is always to the right of the first nonzero number of the row above it. \n",
    "All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeroes. \n",
    "The identity matrix would be an example of a matrix in row echelon form. \n",
    "We should perform our row operations on both the left hand and right hand matrices. Once we are done converting our left hand matrix into row echelon form, our right hand matrix will be the inverse of the original matrix. \n",
    "Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with i=1, j=1, and matrix Z. \n",
    "Concatenate Z with its identity matrix, make matrix X. \n",
    "Is everything in the column j at and below X[i][j] zero? If yes, increment j and restart from the top. \n",
    "If j equals the number of columns in Z, we are done. \n",
    "k is the row index of the first non-zero column entry. \n",
    "If k!=i, swap row k and row i, so that the highest value is reduced first. \n",
    "Divide row i by X[i][j], in order to make X[i][j]=1. \n",
    "Iterate through all the non-i rows, and subtract their j-column value times the i-row from them. This will ensure that all values in column j that are not in row i will be zero. This is a requirement of row echelon form. \n",
    "If i equals the number of rows in X or j equals the number of columns in the original matrix Z (not counting the identity), we are done. \n",
    "Otherwise, increment i and j and start from the top.\n",
    "This algorithm will loop through each column, and convert it to row-echelon form. At the end, the right side of the matrix X will be the solution, the inverse.\n",
